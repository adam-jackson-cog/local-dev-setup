# Sequential Thinking MCP Server Setup Guide for VS Code

This guide walks you through setting up the Sequential Thinking MCP server for VS Code integration, enabling advanced structured problem-solving and analytical thinking capabilities directly within your coding environment.

## üìã Prerequisites

- **VS Code** installed and configured
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed
- **macOS** (this guide is specifically for macOS environments)

### Installing Node.js (if not already installed)

```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install node

# Or download from https://nodejs.org/
```

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Option 1: Automated Setup Script

1. Download and run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup-sequential-thinking.sh
   ```

2. Restart VS Code completely
3. Test by asking for complex problem-solving queries in the chat interface

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### Step 1: Verify Sequential Thinking MCP Package

The Sequential Thinking MCP server will be installed automatically via npx when VS Code starts. No global installation is required.

#### Step 2: Test Package Availability

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking --help
```

#### Step 3: Configure VS Code Settings

Add the following configuration to your VS Code `settings.json` file:

**Location:** `/Users/[YOUR_USER_ID]/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json`

```json
{
    "mcp": {
        "servers": {
            "sequential-thinking": {
                "command": "npx",
                "args": [
                    "-y",
                    "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
                ],
                "env": {}
            }
        },
        "inputs": []
    }
}
```

If you already have MCP servers configured, add the sequential-thinking server to your existing configuration:

```json
{
    "mcp": {
        "servers": {
            "context7": {
                "command": "npx",
                "args": [
                    "-y",
                    "@upstash/context7-mcp"
                ],
                "env": {}
            },
            "sequential-thinking": {
                "command": "npx",
                "args": [
                    "-y",
                    "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
                ],
                "env": {}
            },
            "biomcp": {
                "command": "biomcp",
                "args": ["run", "--mode", "stdio"]
            }
        },
        "inputs": []
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Restart VS Code

Completely restart VS Code for the MCP server configuration to take effect.

## üß™ Testing the Installation

1. Open VS Code
2. Start a chat session
3. Ask for complex problem-solving queries, such as:
   - "Help me break down this algorithm design problem step by step"
   - "Analyze the trade-offs of different architectural approaches"
   - "Walk through debugging this complex issue systematically"

## üîß Available Sequential Thinking MCP Tools

Once configured, you'll have access to the following analytical thinking tools:

### Core Tool
- **`mcp_sequential-th_sequentialthinking`** - Dynamic and reflective problem-solving through structured thoughts

### Key Features
- **Flexible thinking process** that can adapt and evolve
- **Multi-step analysis** with room for revision and course correction
- **Hypothesis generation and verification**
- **Branching and backtracking** capabilities
- **Context maintenance** across multiple thinking steps
- **Uncertainty expression** and alternative approach exploration

## üîç Example Usage

### Complex Algorithm Design
```
"Help me design an efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets with specific constraints"
```

### Architecture Decision Analysis
```
"Analyze the trade-offs between microservices and monolithic architecture for my project"
```

### Debugging Complex Issues
```
"Walk me through debugging this performance issue systematically"
```

### Code Review and Optimization
```
"Help me analyze this code for potential improvements and optimizations"
```

## üß† How Sequential Thinking Works

The Sequential Thinking tool provides a structured approach to problem-solving:

1. **Initial Analysis** - Break down the problem into components
2. **Iterative Thinking** - Process through multiple thought steps
3. **Revision Capability** - Question and revise previous thoughts
4. **Branching Logic** - Explore alternative approaches
5. **Hypothesis Testing** - Generate and verify solutions
6. **Final Synthesis** - Provide comprehensive answers

### Parameters
- **thought** - Current thinking step with analysis or insights
- **thought_number** - Sequential numbering of thoughts
- **total_thoughts** - Estimated thoughts needed (adjustable)
- **next_thought_needed** - Whether more analysis is required
- **is_revision** - Flag for revising previous thinking
- **branch_from_thought** - Starting point for alternative approaches

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: MCP Tools Not Available

**Symptoms:** Sequential Thinking tools don't appear in the chat interface after restart

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Node.js and npm are installed:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

2. Test Sequential Thinking MCP package manually:
   ```bash
   npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking --help
   ```

3. Check VS Code settings.json syntax:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('/Users/[USER_ID]/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json'))"
   ```

4. Ensure complete VS Code restart (not just reload window)

### Issue: Package Download Failures

**Symptoms:** Long startup times or npm errors

**Solutions:**
1. Clear npm cache:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

2. Test network connectivity:
   ```bash
   npm ping
   ```

3. Check corporate firewall/proxy settings if applicable

### Issue: Thinking Process Seems Incomplete

**Symptoms:** Analysis stops prematurely or lacks depth

**Solutions:**
1. Ask for more detailed analysis explicitly
2. Request revision of specific thinking steps
3. Ask for alternative approaches or branching logic
4. Use phrases like "think through this more systematically"
