   ./mcp/setup-biomcp.sh
   
   # For documentation access
   chmod +x mcp/setup-context7.sh
   ./mcp/setup-context7.sh
   
   # For structured problem solving
   chmod +x mcp/setup-sequential-thinking.sh
   ./mcp/setup-sequential-thinking.sh
   ```

5. **Install GitHub Copilot configurations to your project (optional):**
   ```bash
   # Install to a specific project directory
   chmod +x github-copilot/install-copilot-chat.sh
   ./github-copilot/install-copilot-chat.sh ~/path/to/your/project
   
   # Or install to current directory
   ./github-copilot/install-copilot-chat.sh .
   ```

6. **Restart your terminal and VS Code**
